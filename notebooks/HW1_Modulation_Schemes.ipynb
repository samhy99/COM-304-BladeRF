    "**Important Note:** Clone the whole gitHub repo then start working on this file in the cloned repo. \n",
    "There might be some other files in the repo that are used.\n",
    "So if you only download this file and work on it, you might have porblems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, RF signals are everywhere in our society: try to use a spectrum analyser such as the gqrx (https://gqrx.dk/) software together with the bladeRF and try to identify some common signals on the VHF/UHF side of the spectrum; you may use the SigID Wiki (https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Signal_Identification_Guide) which is a comprehensive amateur collection of common signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually, you will see a great range of signal shapes on the waterfall plot (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_plot), which indicate different modulation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, radio frequency (RF) signals assume integral roles across various facets of our society, functioning systematically to facilitate crucial communication. They range through mobile networks, terrestrial environments (encompassing both line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight communication channels), satellite-based communications, and even extend to underwater realms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the code-breaking programs that took place at Bletchley Park during World War II, the dominance of the electromagnetic spectrum (collection & analysis of signals or disruption of unwanted channels) has been and remains a major technological and political challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this lab, you will be assigned 3 Mysterious signals based on common modulation schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your objective will be to positively identify them and then demodulate them and recover the \"secret\" message they contain.\n",
    "**Very Important:** There are ten folders on moodle for the data. \n",
    "You must download the file with the number that matches the last digit of your SCIPER number and decode the secrect messages in that folder. \n",
    "Your task is to complete this code by writing the functions 'demodulate_signal_1', 'demodulate_signal_2', and 'demodulate_signal_3'. \n",
    "These functions should demodulate the given signal based on your insights from the constellation plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "After you are done, you should submit the following files on moodle: \n",
    "- Your code \n",
    "- The secret messages you extracted \n",
    "\n",
    "Your grade is specified based on your code and the correct docoded secrect message. \n",
