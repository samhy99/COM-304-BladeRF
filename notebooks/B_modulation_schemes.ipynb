    "Nowadays, RF signals are everywhere in our society: try to use a spectrum analyser such as the gqrx (https://gqrx.dk/) software together with the bladeRF and try to identify some common signals on the VHF/UHF side of the spectrum; you may use the SigID Wiki (https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Signal_Identification_Guide) which is a comprehensive amateur collection of common signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually, you will see a great range of signal shapes on the waterfall plot (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_plot), which indicate different modulation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, radio frequency (RF) signals assume integral roles across various facets of our society, functioning systematically to facilitate crucial communication. They range through mobile networks, terrestrial environments (encompassing both line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight communication channels), satellite-based communications, and even extend to underwater realms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the code-breaking programs that took place at Bletchley Park during World War II, the dominance of the electromagnetic spectrum (collection & analysis of signals or disruption of unwanted channels) has been and remains a major technological and political challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this lab, you will be assigned 3 Mysterious signals based on common modulation schemes that you have studied in earlier notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your objective will be to positively identify them and then demodulate them and recover the \"secret\" message they contain.\n",
    "You will find your assigned signals available to you on moodle. Your task is to complete this code by writing the functions 'demodulate_signal_1', 'demodulate_signal_2', and 'demodulate_signal_3'. These functions should demodulate the given signal based on your insights from the constellation plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "After you are done, you should submit the following files on moodle: \n",
    "- Your code \n",
    "- The secret messages you extracted \n",
    "\n",
    "<i>For ML enthusiasts: can you find a way to automatically classify and demodulate signals using deep learning?</i>\n",
