    "Now, it's time to demodulate the data symbols we obtained using BPSK. First, implement a simple hard-decision demapper for BPSK symbols. The previous constellation plot might be useful in determining a good threshold. Then demodulate based on this threshold. Note that in our demodulation scheme, the 0 bits are mapped to -1, and the 1 bits are mapped to +1. Please append all the demodulated data (0 and 1 bits) into an array. This array will be used in the final part of the lab. "
